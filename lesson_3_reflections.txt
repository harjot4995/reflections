When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share the project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other contributers might have added their version which i don't want, so it's useless if it automatically pull changes in repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork:Copy a repository on someone's github to your github.Github counts the number of people who fork your repository.

Clone:Making a repository in the local machine which exsits on github.

Branches:Branches consists of commits that are related to that particular branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can merge it later to update origin/master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be difficult to contact each person and ask for their code.Also after doing the changes it would be hard to ask people to review it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?


Whenever I want to test the feature which I don't know will work.I can make changes in the branch without changing the master branch.
