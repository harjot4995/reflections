How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The code was small and concise

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Different versions of the file are available

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:No data redundency if versions are same
    cons:Losing the version of file if it wasn't manually commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Interrelated files can be changed in a  single commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff <filename_old>  <filename_new>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very confident ,as it won't affect the main project

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Bug Fixing
